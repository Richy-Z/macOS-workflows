## Workflows

### Skip Apple Quarantine and Run

This workflow skips the quarantine check by removing the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute from the selected file using the `xattr` command.

If the selected file is an application bundle (`.app`) or an executable binary, it will then attempt to run it.

‚ö†Ô∏è Use this workflow with caution. Bypassing Gatekeeper's security checks can potentially expose your system to security risks. Only use this on files from trusted sources that you have verified as safe.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

These workflows are designed for advanced users who understand the potential risks involved in bypassing macOS security features. Always exercise caution when using these workflows, especially with files from unknown or untrusted sources.
